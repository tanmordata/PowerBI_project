# NCAA KPI powerBI dashboard

This project was inspired from workout-wednesday.com weekly powerBI challenges. In it, we analyze the KPIs of the NCAA, which include revenues, expenses and profits. From there, slicers and drillthrough capabilities are added to allow interactivity between the summary page and the school breakdown page.
